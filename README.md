## Introduction

This project is a basic implementation of the classic Snake game using Python. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food, which makes the snake grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## Features

- **Game Setup:** Window creation and snake initialization at the center.
- **User Controls:** Arrow keys to change the snake's direction.
- **Food Generation:** Randomly placed food items for the snake to eat.
- **Collision Handling:** Detection of collisions with walls or the snake itself.
- **Scoring:** Score tracking and display as the snake eats food items.
